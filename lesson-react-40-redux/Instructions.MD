The `examples` folder contains an application created using `react-create-app`

Read the `examples/todo-app/README.md` for information about the app generator.

The `examples/todo-app/src/name` folder contains the source code for the examples in the
Power Point slides.

## How to run the example

start the application in the default browser.
